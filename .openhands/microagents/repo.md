# YYK Test Repository

## Project Description

This is a test repository for OpenHands microagents, designed to experiment with and demonstrate microagent functionality. The repository serves as a sandbox environment for testing various microagent implementations and their capabilities within the OpenHands ecosystem.

## Development Information

This is a minimal repository with no specific build process, dependencies, or test suite. The main purpose is to serve as a testing ground for OpenHands microagents.

### Git History
- The repository previously contained a story-teller microagent that was later removed
- The project follows a standard Git workflow with pull requests for feature additions

## Getting Started

For new developers working with this repository:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/hieptl/yyk-test.git`
2. The repository is ready to use immediately - no installation or setup required
3. Add new microagents by creating `.md` files in the `.openhands/microagents/` directory
4. Follow the existing commit message conventions when contributing changes

This repository serves as a clean slate for testing OpenHands microagent functionality and can be extended with additional microagents as needed.
