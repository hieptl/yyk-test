# YYK Test Repository

## Project Description

This is a test repository for OpenHands microagents, owned by hieptl. The repository serves as a testing ground for developing and experimenting with microagent functionality within the OpenHands ecosystem. Based on the git history, it has been used to test microagent creation, management, and removal workflows.

## File Structure

```
yyk-test/
├── README.md                           # Empty project README
└── .openhands/
    └── microagents/
        └── repo.md                     # This documentation file
```

The repository maintains a minimal structure with just a README file at the root level. The `.openhands/microagents/` directory is used to store microagent-related files and documentation.

## Development Information

This repository appears to be primarily used for testing OpenHands microagent functionality rather than containing a traditional application with tests or build processes. There are no package managers, test frameworks, or build tools configured.

### Git History Notes
- The repository previously contained a story-teller microagent that was later removed
- All commits show proper co-authoring with OpenHands
- The main branch is actively maintained

## Getting Started

For new developers working with this repository:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/hieptl/yyk-test.git`
2. This is primarily a testing repository, so no additional setup or dependencies are required
3. Use this repository to experiment with OpenHands microagent development and testing workflows
4. Follow standard Git practices when contributing changes

Since this is a test repository, there are no specific commands to run tests or start applications. The primary use case is for testing OpenHands microagent functionality and workflows.
