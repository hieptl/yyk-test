# YYK Test Repository

## Project Description

This is a minimal test repository (`yyk-test`) that appears to be used for experimenting with OpenHands functionality and microagents. The repository currently contains only a basic README file and serves as a sandbox environment for testing various OpenHands features and workflows.

Based on the git history, this repository previously contained OpenHands microagents (specifically a story-teller microagent) that have since been removed, indicating its primary purpose as a testing ground for OpenHands development and experimentation.

## File Structure

```
yyk-test/
├── README.md          # Empty README file
└── .git/             # Git repository metadata
```

The repository has a very minimal structure with just the essential files. The `.openhands/microagents/` directory is being added to house microagent documentation and configurations.

## Running Tests

Currently, there are no tests, build scripts, or dependencies configured in this repository. This is a minimal setup without any specific testing framework or commands.

## Getting Started

For new developers working with this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**: The repo is already set up with basic git configuration
2. **No dependencies**: There are no package managers, dependencies, or build tools to install
3. **Purpose**: This appears to be a testing/experimental repository for OpenHands features
4. **History**: Check `git log` to see previous experiments with microagents that were added and later removed

Since this is a test repository, developers can use it to experiment with OpenHands features, test microagent functionality, or practice git workflows without affecting production code.
