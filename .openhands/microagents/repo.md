# YYK Test Repository

## Project Description

This is a test repository for OpenHands microagents development and testing. The repository serves as a sandbox environment for creating, testing, and validating microagent functionality. Based on the git history, it has been used to develop and test story-telling microagents and other OpenHands capabilities.

## File Structure

```
yyk-test/
├── README.md                           # Empty project readme
├── .openhands/                         # OpenHands configuration directory
│   └── microagents/                    # Directory for microagent definitions
│       └── repo.md                     # This documentation file
└── .git/                              # Git repository metadata
```

The repository follows a minimal structure focused on microagent development. The `.openhands/microagents/` directory is the primary location for storing microagent definition files.

## Development Information

This repository appears to be primarily used for:
- Testing OpenHands microagent functionality
- Validating microagent creation and deployment workflows
- Experimenting with different microagent configurations

### Running Tests
